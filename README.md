# **Fundamentals of Image Processing**

## **Project Description**

The "Fundamentals of Image Processing" is a simple yet powerful image processing application built with Python, Streamlit, and OpenCV. This project demonstrates the basic principles and techniques used in image processing, including filters, transformations, and effects. Users can upload images and apply various processing techniques to analyze and manipulate the images.

### **Key Features:**
- **Image Upload**: Upload any image (JPG, PNG, JPEG) to the web interface.
- **Simple Halftone**: Apply a simple halftone effect to convert an image into black and white pixel patterns.
- **Difference of Gaussians (DoG)**: Apply Gaussian blur and subtract the results for edge detection.
- **Thresholding**: Apply dynamic thresholding based on pixel values for segmentation.

This project helps users understand and implement the basic image processing operations using Python, making it suitable for both beginners and professionals looking to explore image manipulation.
